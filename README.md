# Minesweeper
My version of Minesweeper in C++, created in the summer of 2022 for COP 3503C at the University of Florida

This Project was the final project in the class of COP 3503C. WE created our own version of Minesweeper with the images they provided.
My version was done on Microsoft Visual Studio, where I had to configure the SFML library in order to get the images to load and work
the way I wanted. All of the main files that are used are in the Project3 folder. With the aid of the professors, we were given the
TextureManager file to have an easier way of loading the images that will be used for the board. All of the functions I use are loacted
in the main.cpp. The Boards folder holds the information for how the mines will be placed around the board, mainly for debug purposes. 
The default size for the board is a 16 row and 25 collumn board that holds 50 mines. If desired, the size of the board and the amount 
of mines can be changed in the config.cfg file, but will not work with the other boards in the Boards folder. I hope you enjoy this
classic game, it is always a fun pastime.
